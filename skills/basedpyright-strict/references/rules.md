# basedpyright rule catalog and mechanics

Researched 2026-07-01 against basedpyright docs (`https://docs.basedpyright.com/latest/`).
Rules shift between releases — when a rule here doesn't match what triage
prints, trust the installed version's docs
(`https://docs.basedpyright.com/latest/configuration/config-files/` has the
per-mode rule matrix).

## Running (what triage.py does under the hood)

- `uvx basedpyright` — no install needed (PyPI package bundles node); it
  auto-detects `./.venv` as the interpreter. No `.venv` → pass
  `--pythonpath <interpreter>`.
- Files passed on the CLI override config include/exclude (subset checks);
  `-` reads a NUL/newline file list from stdin (changed-files-only runs).
- `--outputjson` fields per diagnostic: `file` (abs), `severity`
  (error|warning|information), `message`, optional `rule` (absent for
  syntax errors), `range.start/end.line/character` (zero-based).
- Exit: 0 clean, 1 errors, 2 internal fatal, 3 config unreadable, 4 bad CLI.
- `--level error` hides warnings; `--threads` parallelizes.
- Default mode when unconfigured is `recommended` (harsher than strict, and
  `failOnWarnings = true`) — always set the mode explicitly.

## Config quick reference (`[tool.basedpyright]`)

- Mode ladder: `off < basic < standard < strict < recommended < all`
  (recommended/all are basedpyright-only; recommended = all rules with
  error/warning severity split + failOnWarnings).
- Per-rule override: `reportX = "error" | "warning" | "information" | "none"`.
- `strict = ["src/core"]` — per-path strict; `executionEnvironments` give
  per-dir rule overrides but NOT per-env typeCheckingMode (open issue #1638).
- `allowedUntypedLibraries = ["pkg"]` — mutes reportMissingTypeStubs and
  reportUnknown* for those imports (for libs with no stubs on PyPI).
- File pragmas override config: `# pyright: strict`,
  `# pyright: basic, reportPrivateUsage=false`.
- A `pyrightconfig.json` silently takes precedence over pyproject.toml.

## Baseline mechanics (read before --writebaseline)

- `uvx basedpyright --writebaseline` → `.basedpyright/baseline.json`; commit it.
- Matching key is **file path + rule + column range** (not line number), so
  edits elsewhere in a file don't resurface baselined errors — but renames
  and refactors that shift columns DO. Recovery: rerun `--writebaseline`.
- The baseline auto-shrinks as baselined errors get fixed (`--baselinemode
  auto` is the default ratchet; `lock`/`discard` exist).
- Regenerate only when errors incorrectly resurface or after enabling new
  rules. One-off suppressions use `# pyright: ignore[rule]`, never the
  baseline.
- Two same-rule errors at the same column in one file can alias each other.

## Tier A — mechanical, fix is always runtime-safe

| Rule | Meaning → safe fix |
|---|---|
| reportMissingParameterType / reportMissingTypeArgument | Unannotated param / bare generic → annotate (`list[str]`, not `list`); infer from call sites and docstrings. |
| reportUnknown{Variable,Member,Argument,Parameter,Lambda}Type | Type is partially Any — cascades from ONE untyped source. Annotate the source (function signature, lib boundary, stub); never patch usage sites one by one. |
| reportMissingTypeStubs | Untyped third-party import → `uv add --dev types-<pkg>`; no stubs on PyPI → `allowedUntypedLibraries`. Never hand-write stubs that guess behavior. |
| reportMissingModuleSource | Stub without source — informational; suppress or ignore. |
| reportUnannotatedClassAttribute | Annotate the attr. Never add a value that wasn't there. |
| reportImplicitOverride | Add `@override` (`typing` on 3.12+, else `typing_extensions` — note: new runtime dependency on <3.12). |
| reportPrivateLocalImportUsage | Re-export with redundant alias: `from x import y as y`. |
| reportImplicitRelativeImport | `import foo` in a package → `from . import foo`. Check the module isn't also run as a script first. |
| reportUnusedCallResult | Assign to `_ = f(...)`. Teams often disable this rule instead. |
| reportIgnoreCommentWithoutRule | Add the rule name into the brackets. |
| reportDeprecated / reportTypeCommentUsage | Modernize (type comments → real annotations). |

## Tier B — the checker may be right; judgment per site

| Rule | Meaning → approach |
|---|---|
| reportOptional{MemberAccess,Subscript,Call,Iterable,Operand} | `T \| None` used as `T`. Ladder: source annotation lie → fix it; impossible-here → `pyright: ignore[rule]`; genuinely reachable → latent bug, FLAG. The single most common strict-mode error class. |
| reportAttributeAccessIssue | Annotation too wide (fix: narrow / Protocol / overloads) or a real typo/dead path (FLAG as bug). |
| reportArgumentType / reportCallIssue / reportAssignmentType / reportReturnType / reportIndexIssue / reportOperatorIssue | Declared types disagree. Usually the annotation is the lie (e.g. `-> str` that returns `str \| None`) — correcting it is safe and surfaces the callers that were always broken. Code wrong → FLAG. |
| reportPossiblyUnboundVariable | Assigned only in some branches. No pure-annotation fix exists: pre-initializing changes a NameError crash into a flowing value. Use `pyright: ignore[reportPossiblyUnboundVariable]` and FLAG if the unbound path looks reachable. |
| reportUnnecessaryComparison / reportUnnecessaryIsInstance / reportUnnecessaryContains / reportUnreachable | "Dead" per the declared types — but on a freshly typed repo the types are often the lie. Never delete the code in this pass: fix the annotation or ignore-with-rule. |

## Tier C — Any-policing (basedpyright-exclusive)

`reportAny`, `reportExplicitAny`: fix at the source when cheap (annotate /
stub / `object` + narrowing); otherwise set both to `"none"` during adoption
and list re-enabling them as a next ratchet in the report.

## Tier D — commonly suppressed on legacy repos

`reportUnusedCallResult`, `reportMissingSuperCall`,
`reportUnnecessaryTypeIgnoreComment` (known false positives around
overloads, issue #496), `reportUninitializedInstanceVariable`,
`reportUnsafeMultipleInheritance`, `reportImplicitAbstractClass` (its "fix"
— adding an ABC base — is behavior-modifying: instantiation starts raising).
Downgrade to `"none"` with a config comment rather than scattering ignores.

## Ignore-comment semantics (why the skill bans bare ignores)

- basedpyright disables `# type: ignore` by default
  (`enableTypeIgnoreComments = false`): per PEP 484 it suppresses ALL
  diagnostics on the line, and even `# type: ignore[rule]` ignores the
  bracket contents. Leave it disabled.
- `# pyright: ignore[rule]` is rule-scoped and validated;
  `reportUnnecessaryTypeIgnoreComment` can flag it when stale. A wrong
  `cast` is never flagged (except non-overlapping casts via
  `reportInvalidCast`) — which is why ignores outrank casts on the ladder.
- Repo also runs mypy → dual comments are unavoidable:
  `# type: ignore[x]  # pyright: ignore[y]`.

## Annotation runtime gotchas (the "safe" fixes that aren't, without care)

- Annotations are evaluated at runtime on <3.14 unless
  `from __future__ import annotations` is present — an annotation-only
  import or forward reference can raise NameError at import time. Adding
  the future import is itself safe and is the standard companion edit.
- `if TYPE_CHECKING:` imports are safe by construction; pair with the
  future import (or quoted annotations).
- `@overload` bodies never run; only the implementation does — keep it
  untouched.
- `cast(T, x)` returns `x` unchanged at runtime; `assert_type` is also a
  runtime call (no-op, but an import + call — avoid in hot paths, fine in
  tests).
