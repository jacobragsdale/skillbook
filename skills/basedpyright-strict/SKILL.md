# Strict type checking with basedpyright

Turn on `typeCheckingMode = "strict"` for a Python repo and drive the error
count down using only fixes that cannot change runtime behavior. basedpyright
runs through `uvx` — nothing is installed into the project except `types-*`
stub dev-dependencies. This skill gates on **error-severity diagnostics
only**; warnings are a later ratchet, offered in the final report.

**Before executing, read `LEARNINGS.md` in this skill's folder** — entries
there override the instructions below.

## Bundled resources

- `scripts/setup_config.py` — **run** once to write `[tool.basedpyright]`.
- `scripts/triage.py` — **run** for every check: tiered worklist, `--json`
  snapshots, `--diff` against a snapshot. Never run bare `uvx basedpyright`
  for triage; the script's grouping is the deterministic worklist.
- `scripts/audit_diff.py` — **run** before finishing: flags behavior-smelling
  added lines (asserts, guards, bare ignores, uncommented casts).
- `references/rules.md` — **read** when a rule isn't covered by the fix
  policy below, and for baseline mechanics before writing a baseline.

## Step 0 — Preflight

- Require a clean `git status`; work on a branch.
- Find the behavior oracle: the repo's test command. Run it once and record
  the result — the suite must end in the identical state. No test suite →
  tell the user verification will be type-only.
- Note the version triage prints; rules shift between basedpyright releases.

## Step 1 — Configure

Run `setup_config.py` in the repo root. Exit 2 means config already exists
(a `pyrightconfig.json` silently overrides pyproject — reconcile into one
place); keep `typeCheckingMode = "strict"` either way.

## Step 2 — Triage and plan

```bash
uv run <skill>/scripts/triage.py --project <repo> --json /tmp/tri-0.json
```

Report to the user before fixing anything: total errors, the rule/tier
table, and the plan. Fix everything feasible; if volume or Tier B judgment
sites make zero infeasible, say which portion will be baselined at the end.
The baseline is the remainder, never the strategy — do not skip to it.

## Step 3 — Fix, in this order

Each numbered batch is one commit. After each batch:
`triage.py --diff <last-snapshot>` — zero NEW errors allowed; save a fresh
snapshot. While iterating inside a batch, pass just the touched files to
`triage.py` for fast subset checks; full run at the commit.

1. **Stubs**: `uv add --dev types-<pkg>` for each `reportMissingTypeStubs`;
   `allowedUntypedLibraries` in config for libs with no stubs. Never
   hand-write stubs that guess at behavior.
2. **Cascade sources**: triage lists error-dense files. Annotate the
   most-imported unannotated signatures first — `reportUnknown*` errors
   cascade from single untyped boundaries; one signature fix can clear
   hundreds. Fix the source, never each usage site.
3. **Tier A rules** (mechanical annotations), highest count first, one rule
   per batch.
4. **Tier B** (Optional handling, argument/attribute mismatches),
   module-by-module — these need the module's invariants; apply the fix
   policy per site.
5. **Remainder**: `uvx basedpyright --writebaseline -p <repo>`, commit
   `.basedpyright/baseline.json`. Read the baseline notes in
   `references/rules.md` first.

## Fix policy

**Safe — apply freely (pure type-domain edits):**

- Annotations on parameters, returns, variables, class attributes. Two
  traps: never add a default value that wasn't there, and never turn a
  bare annotation into an assignment (a class attribute that didn't exist
  must not start existing).
- `from __future__ import annotations`, and imports moved under
  `if TYPE_CHECKING:` (also relieves annotation-only circular imports).
- `Protocol`, `TypeVar`, `ParamSpec`, `@overload` — as long as the
  implementation body is untouched.
- `uv add --dev types-*` stub packages.
- Correcting a lying annotation to the truth (e.g. `-> str` on a function
  that returns `str | None`), then handling the errors that surface at
  callers — those errors were always there; the lie hid them.
- `# pyright: ignore[specificRule]` — always with the rule in brackets.

**Forbidden — these change what the program does. Skip, flag, report:**

- `assert x is not None` — new exception path, and stripped under `python -O`.
- `if x is None:` guards, early returns, `isinstance()` checks — new control
  flow; isinstance also breaks duck-typed callers.
- Deleting "unreachable" code or "always-true" comparisons — on a freshly
  typed repo the annotation is as likely the lie as the code.
- Changing signatures, defaults, parameter names; mutable-default rewrites.
- Adding ABC bases, `@abstractmethod`, metaclasses, `__slots__`, dataclass
  conversions.
- Bare `# type: ignore` or bare `# pyright: ignore` (basedpyright disables
  `type: ignore` by default; leave it disabled).
- `Any` or `cast` used to silence an error you cannot explain.

**Escape-hatch ladder — take the first rung that truthfully applies:**

1. Fix the type at its source (annotation or stub).
2. `# pyright: ignore[rule]` at the site.
3. Baseline entry (bulk pre-existing debt only, never one-offs).
4. `cast(T, x)` — only for out-of-band truth the checker can't express;
   REQUIRED same-line comment stating the invariant.
5. `Any` in the smallest possible scope; never on a public API.

**When strict mode reveals a real bug** (a reachable None-deref, a genuine
typo): do not fix the behavior in this pass — the typing change must stay
mechanically reviewable. Suppress, flag with the exact format below, and put
it in the final report:

```python
x.frob()  # pyright: ignore[ruleName]  # FIXME(behavior): <why safe fixes don't apply + the real fix>
```

## Example

```python
user = find_user(uid)   # find_user() -> User | None
send(user.email)        # error: reportOptionalMemberAccess
```

- `find_user` can never return `None` (annotation is the lie) → rung 1: fix
  its return annotation to `User`.
- `None` is impossible *here* but possible elsewhere (uid came from a live
  session) → rung 2:
  `send(user.email)  # pyright: ignore[reportOptionalMemberAccess]`
- `None` is genuinely reachable → latent bug, flag it:
  `send(user.email)  # pyright: ignore[reportOptionalMemberAccess]  # FIXME(behavior): stale uid returns None; needs a guard — decide handling`

## Step 4 — Verify and report

All four, in order:

- [ ] `triage.py` full run: 0 errors, or only the baselined remainder.
- [ ] Test suite: identical result to the Step 0 run.
- [ ] `audit_diff.py` clean — or every finding restated in the report.
- [ ] Commits are per-batch and mechanical (one rule/module per commit).

End with this report (all sections REQUIRED):

```markdown
## basedpyright-strict report
- Before: <N> errors | After: <M> errors | Baselined: <K>
- Commits: <one line each>
- Flagged sites needing your decision:
  | file:line | rule | why risky | proposed real fix |
- Suggested next ratchets: warnings pass / failOnWarnings, recommended mode, reportAny
```

## Improving this skill

Before executing, read `LEARNINGS.md` in this skill's folder — entries there
override the instructions above. After use, if the user corrected you or the
outcome surprised you, append one dated line to `LEARNINGS.md`:
`- YYYY-MM-DD: <what happened> → <what to do instead>`. Do not edit SKILL.md
directly; lessons are folded in deliberately, not on the fly.
